\vfill
Principe :
\begin{itemize}
\item Maillage classique du domaine en «~$\lambda_{\min}$ sur $10$~» ;
\item Présence de petites mailles dûes aux contraintes géométriques (antennes) ;
\item Algorithme de réduction de l'ordre d'interpolation de ces mailles tout en respectant le critère «~$\lambda_{\min}$ sur $10$~».
\end{itemize}
\vfill
Résultats :
\begin{itemize}
\item Facteur d'accélération de $3.8$ sur le cas de la tête simplifiée (dernière section) ;
\item A permis de réaliser la simulation sur corps humain (dernière section) ;
\item Particulièrement efficace sur les maillages en tétraèdres découpés :
\end{itemize}
